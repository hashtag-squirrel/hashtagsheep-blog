Hello! Here I am, writing a blog again.

It's been a while since I created content around a personal interest. Back in the day, it was mostly software engineering and the fun you can have building games, because that's actually my day job.

Over the last few years, I rediscovered a hobby from my childhood: woodworking and making things that aren't purely digital. Looking back, one of my favorite school subjects was "Shop class/Crafting". We mostly worked with wood, sometimes other materials, and even sewing. I had so much fun that I kept tinkering at home with my grandpa, a retired teacher of this very subject. He also worked at a local carpentry company known for traditional Christmas decorations, so he had plenty of hands-on experience to share.

Fast forward a bit: I started working as a software engineer at a big gaming company in Germany. At some point, I realized I needed a hobby that wasn't behind a screen (though there's a twist coming). I'm still a gamer, I still love personal software projects, and I keep up with tech... but I needed balance. So I grabbed a drill and a sander from the local store (good old Bosch DIY), picked up some wood, and built a super simple table because I had no weekend plans.

Finishing that small project felt amazing. Naturally, I wanted more. More projects... and yep, more tools (I'm a tech nerd, I like shiny things). I set up a small workshop in my basement and started playing with different techniques. Nothing major, just practicing and learning.

Then came Sweden. I moved for an exciting job opportunity, but our first apartment had no basement or storage. I had to sell most of my machines back in Germany. What I kept were my battery tools and anything that fit in a box, just waiting for the day I'd have space again.

In that apartment, I assembled and customized shelves, and even built an epic stand for the Lego Star Wars Super Star Destroyer (yes, Lego and Star Wars, those are also interests of mine). But it wasn't quite enough to scratch the maker itch. Eventually, we bought a house, and I finally had room for a proper (tiny) workshop and this is where the journey truly began. A few years later, the shed is still tiny, but I've grown a lot. Not just in tool count.

About stepping away from digital stuff: that didn't last long. As I tackled more advanced projects, I started learning CAD software (turns out that's a handy skill if you've worked in game development) and even got into 3D printing to support my woodworking. But that's a story for another post.

## So why a blog, and what's this about?

Let's start with the why. I consume a lot of woodworking content in all formats. While I enjoy videos, I sometimes miss the good old written word, something I can read quietly, at my own pace, without audio or distraction. Plus, for me, writing is easier than filming (massive respect to the video creators out there).

There's also an Instagram and Facebook page (and maybe a YouTube channel down the road) for those who prefer moving pictures. I enjoy the simple things, but I'm not from yesterday.

This blog will cover all the classic topics: tips and tricks, beginner guides, project showcases, tool reviews, and personal stories from the shed. Basically, anything I've learned as a passionate, not-quite-professional maker.

Sure, there are tons of folks doing similar things. But honestly? This blog is mostly for me. If others enjoy it too and a little community grows out of it that's a nice bonus.

## What's with the sheep stuff?

Ah yes. The sheep.

Simple answer: I like sheep. They're cuddly, clever, and the world could use more of them. Period.

The hashtag? A light-hearted jab at social media culture. I'm part of it like most people, but I enjoy poking a bit of fun too.
