This is a personal blog created and maintained for private and non-commercial purposes. Your privacy is important, and this site is designed to minimize data collection.

## 1. Data collection

This site uses two privacy-respecting analytics tools:

### a) Plausible Analytics

Plausible is a **privacy-first, cookie-free analytics platform**. It collects only aggregated, non-personal data to help understand overall traffic and site usage trends.

The following data points are collected:

- **Page URL** - The path and hostname of the visited page
- **HTTP Referrer** - The previous site that linked to the page (if available)
- **Browser & version** - Based on the User-Agent string; full string is discarded
- **Operating system & version** - Based on the User-Agent string; full string is discarded
- **Device type** - Categorized as desktop, tablet, or mobile
- **Geographic location** - Country, region, and city (derived from IP address); IP is discarded and never stored

Plausible does not set cookies, does not store personal data, and does not use persistent identifiers.

### b) Cloudflare server-side analytics

The following data points may be collected:

- **Page views and traffic volume** - Used to monitor load, detect unusual patterns, and maintain uptime
- **Browser & operating system** - Derived from the request headers to identify general trends (e.g. Chrome on Windows)
- **Geographic location** - Country-level location based on anonymized IP data; full IP addresses are not stored or used for tracking

All Cloudflare data is aggregated and used solely for performance and security analysis.

## 2. Cookies

This site does **not use any cookies or local storage** technologies for tracking or personalization.
For more details, see the [Cookie Policy](/cookie-policy).

## 3. No personal data

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data such as names, email addresses, or identifiable IP addresses. There are no contact forms, comment sections, or login systems on this site.

## 4. Data usage

The anonymized usage data collected through Plausible and Cloudflare is used solely to understand traffic patterns, protect site integrity, and improve performance.
