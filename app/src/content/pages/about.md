Hello there! I'm Christoph, the person behind hashtagsheep.

By day, I'm a software engineer... sort of. But when I put on my tinkering hat, it's all about woodworking, 3D printing, and making things I can touch.

My journey into making things started way back in childhood, tinkering alongside my grandpa (who, conveniently, was a shop class teacher). Together we worked on wood projects and traditional crafts. Years later, after moving to Sweden for work, I finally set up my own tiny shed, a small but mighty workshop where I build, learn, and occasionally curse when things don't go as planned.

While this blog is mostly about woodworking and maker culture, you'll also find 3D printing tips, project write-ups, tool reviews, and personal stories from the shed. Expect beginner-friendly guides, honest advice, and the occasional sheep pun (you've been warned).

## Why a blog?

I consume a lot of maker content myself, but sometimes I miss good old-fashioned writing. Videos are great, but there's something special about sitting down and reading at your own pace. Writing also feels natural to me: it's how I process and share what I learn.

In short: this blog is as much for me as it is for anyone reading. If a community grows out of it, that's just a bonus.

## Why sheep?

Simple: Because sheep are great. They're clever, soft, and quietly wonderful.

The "hashtag" part? Just my way of poking fun at modern internet culture while still being part of it.

## Powered by my wife's support

None of this would look as good without my amazing wife. She built this blog and helps me shape content when I get stuck in tool nerd territory. Without her, you'd probably be looking at plain text and half-finished drafts. Thanks for making this little project shine.

## Join the flock

If you're into woodworking, making, or just enjoy following nerdy projects, feel free to stick around. You'll find me here on the blog, and on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/hashtagsheep), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/hashtagsheep) and [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/@hashtagsheep), too. Maybe even YouTube one day.

Welcome to my shed! üêëüîßü™ö
